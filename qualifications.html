		<h1>Qualifications</h1>
		<p>Theodosia's character and experience would make her an excellent candidate for any programming position:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>She has a flexible schedule, and is able to adapt her sleeping hours for any contingency.</li>
			<li>She has a proven track record when it comes to effectively communicating problems to her teammates, having developed a novel meowing strategy she has used throughout her previous positions.</li>
			<li>She has over 5 years of experience with eliminating bugs. Achievements include removing the entire cricket population at both of her places of residence and confirmed kills of several moths.</li>
			<ul> 
				<li><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Theodosia will not take any position that involves removing spiders. She would never attack another huntress, especially one with such a beautiful technique.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Relatedly, she would be eager to help coordinate the development of any spiders a search engine company might need.</li>
			<li>She hones her computer science skills on a daily basis, as seen in the below image:</li>
		 </ul>

		 <br />
		 <p>Here is an example of her coding technique:</p>
		 <pre>
			<code>
function eat(testedFunction, testValue, expectedValue) {
   if (testedFunction(testValue)===expectedValue) {
	  return testedFunction;
   } else {
	  return "";
   };
};
//the below scenario assumes the function variables are not constants
exampleFunction=eat(exampleFunction, varA, varB);
//most problems can be solved by eating them
			</code>
